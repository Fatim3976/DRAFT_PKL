     Parallel version (MPI), running on     2 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =       2
     Waiting for input...
     Reading input from standard input

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3

     Atomic positions and unit cell read from directory:
     ./tmp/graphene1.save/
     Atomic positions from file used, from input discarded

     file C.pbe-n-kjpaw_psl.1.0.0.UPF: wavefunction(s)  2S 2P renormalized

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used
